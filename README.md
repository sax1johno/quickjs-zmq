# ZeroMQ Library and Native Module for QuickJS

## Introduction

> NOTE: You will need to install libzmq on ubuntu

This library is a WIP and very early stages. It will currently only work on linux (and only tested on Ubuntu).  However, it should not take much work to adapt this to other platforms - it just simply hasn't been done yet.
